# Transparency

In the spirit of openness, I'm sharing details of the project's finances. I hope this transparency encourages trust and community support. While it's not possible to quantify the love and energy invested, any and every contribution counts. 🫶


## Current goal 🌱

I'd like to get one of the later (2000) European devices, to study if any of the data was corrected and to confirm the artwork for `Mew`. If you'd like to support this work, consider making a pledge [here](https://github.com/sponsors/ace-dent). 🙏
