Image wrangling with `ImageMagick`, compressed with `Oxipng` and metadata added with `ExifTool`. Additional image compression using `PNGOUT` and `flexiGIF`.

Special thanks to @crait for the original [idea](https://community.arduboy.com/t/pokedex-for-arduboy/12469/16), continuous support and valuable discussions.  

Still images from the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntNE4YyX3tQ) by Alex Pereira and Shane Luis / Rerez, used with kind permission. Expertly filmed in close-up, with minimal movement between shots, ideal focus, and excellent lens selection.
